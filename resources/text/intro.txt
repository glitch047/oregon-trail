Try your hand at a journey across the 2,000 mile Oregon Trail!
As a pioneer in Independence, Missouri, you must outfit and guide a
party of settlers to Oregon's Willamette Valley in 1848.

Choose your profession and supplies carefully - your choices
can be the difference between life and death!

The journey is arduous and fraught with danger, but for those who survive,
a new life awaits in the fertile valleys of Oregon.
